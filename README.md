I have been curious about CAS for quite awhile and in the past have attempted writing an expression parser. At this point, I want to take the time to learn more about this topic.  
The current goal is to get an understanding of the basic logic. I have no intentions of this being a fast or practical system. It will be written from scratch as much as possible since this is an exercise in learning, not writing anything useful.  
  
Currently, this is a very basic calculator which taught me a decent amount about parsing strings. There is tons more work and reading to be done for this to actually be a CAS
